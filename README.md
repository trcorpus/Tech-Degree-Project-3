# Tech-Degree-Project-3

In this project, I have created an application that allows for the user to save work entries into a logbook in the form of a spreadsheet/CSV file. The instructions are as follows:

- In order to prepare better timesheets for your company, you've been asked to develop a terminal application for logging what work someone did on a certain day. The script should ask for a task name, how much time was spent on the task, and any general notes about the task. Record each of these items into a row of a CSV or JSON file along with a date.

- Provide a way for a user to find all of the tasks that were done on a certain date or that match a search string (either as a regular expression or a plain text search). Print a report of this information to the screen, including the date, title of task, time spent, and general notes.

Additionally, I have added a "quit" option to use at any time during the program. The entries can be deleted or edited, allowing for the user to change the date, task name, time spent, and/or notes. Entries can also be searched for and found based on a date range (MM/DD/YYYY), and the entries are displayed one at a time with the ability to page through records (previous/next/back).
